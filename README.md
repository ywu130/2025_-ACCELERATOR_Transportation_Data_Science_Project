# 2025 ACCELERATOR Transportation Data Science Project

This project analyzes the New York City OpenData Transportation dataset for crashes. It is organized and certified by the **Northeast Big Data Innovation Hub (NEBDHub)**. 

I examined NYC crash data from the past ten years, encompassing **2,150,236 accident entries**. The analysis included **exploratory data analysis (EDA), data visualization, time series analysis (TSA), and geospatial analysis**. Key insights extracted from the data include:

- **Unsafe speed** is a leading contributing factor in fatal crashes.
- **Driver inattention** and **failure to yield right-of-way** are major contributing factors in all crashes.
- Crashes exhibit a **daily peak between 4:00 PM and 5:00 PM**.
- The **geospatial distribution of crashes remains consistent** throughout the day, regardless of the time of occurrence.

A **poster** summarizing the findings of this project has been created.
